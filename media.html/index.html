<p><!-- This paragragh talks about Nelson Mandela birth and childhood --!>
    Rolihlahla Mandela was born into the Madiba clan in the village of Mvezo, 
    in the Eastern Cape, on 18 July 1918. His mother was Nonqaphi Nosekeni and 
    his father was Nkosi Mphakanyiswa Gadla Mandela, principal counsellor to the
    Acting King of the Thembu people, Jongintaba Dalindyebo. In 1930, when he 
    was 12 years old, his father died and the young Rolihlahla became a ward of
    Jongintaba at the Great Place in Mqhekezweni1.
    Hearing the elders’ stories of his ancestors’ valour during the wars of 
    resistance, he dreamed also of making his own contribution to the freedom 
    struggle of his people.</p>

     He attended primary school in Qunu where his teacher, Miss Mdingane, gave
     him the name Nelson, in accordance with the custom of giving all 
     schoolchildren “Christian” names.
     He completed his Junior Certificate at Clarkebury Boarding Institute and
     went on to Healdtown, a Wesleyan secondary school of some repute, where he
     matriculated.
     Mandela began his studies for a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University 
     College of Fort Hare but did not complete the degree there as he was expelled
     for joining in a student protest.
     On his return to the Great Place at Mqhekezweni the King was furious and 
     said if he didn’t return to Fort Hare he would arrange wives for him and
     his cousin Justice. They ran away to Johannesburg instead, arriving there
     in 1941. There he worked as a mine security officer and after meeting
     Walter Sisulu, an estate agent, he was introduced to Lazer Sidelsky.
     He then did his articles through a firm of attorneys – Witkin, Eidelman and
     Sidelsky.
     He completed his BA through the University of South Africa and went back to
     Fort Hare for his graduation in 1943.</p>
     <p>Meanwhile, he began studying for an LLB at the University of the
     Witwatersrand. By his own admission he was a poor student and left the 
     university in 1952 without graduating. He only started studying again
     through the University of London after his imprisonment in 1962 but also
     did not complete that degree.
     In 1989, while in the last months of his imprisonment, he obtained an LLB
     through the University of South Africa. He graduated in absentia at a 
     ceremony in Cape Town.</p>  
     <p> <!-- this paragraph talks about his Entering into politics --!>
     Mandela, while increasingly politically involved from 1942, only joined the
     African National Congress in 1944 when he helped to form the ANC Youth League
      (ANCYL).
     In 1944 he married Walter Sisulu’s cousin, Evelyn Mase, a nurse. They had 
     two sons, Madiba Thembekile "Thembi" and Makgatho, and two daughters both 
     called Makaziwe, the first of whom died in infancy. He and his wife divorced in 1958.
     Mandela rose through the ranks of the ANCYL and through its efforts, the 
     ANC adopted a more radical mass-based policy, the Programme of Action, in 
     1949.</p>
     <p> <!--This paragragh talks about nelson MANDELA Treason Trial. --!>
     Mandela was arrested in a countrywide police swoop on 5 December 1956, 
     which led to the 1956 Treason Trial. Men and women of all races found
     themselves in
     the dock in the marathon trial that only ended when the last 28 accused,
     including Mandela, were acquitted on 29 March 1961.</p>
     <p> <!--this paragraph talks about when nelson became and when he died.--!>
     On 10 May 1994 he was inaugurated as South Africa’s first democratically 
     elected President. On his 80th birthday in 1998 he married Graça Machel,
     his third wife.True to his promise, Mandela stepped down in 1999 after one
     term as President. He continued to work with the Nelson Mandela Children’s 
     Fund he set up in 1995 and established the Nelson Mandela Foundation and 
     The Mandela Rhodes Foundation.
     In April 2007 his grandson, Mandla Mandela, was installed as head of the 
     Mvezo Traditional Council at a ceremony at the Mvezo Great Place.
     Nelson Mandela never wavered in his devotion to democracy, equality and
     learning. Despite terrible provocation, he never answered racism with
     racism. His life is an inspiration to all who are oppressed and deprived;
     and to all who are opposed to oppression and deprivation.
     He died at his home in Johannesburg on 5 December 2013.</p> <br><br>
